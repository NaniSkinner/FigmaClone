**Status:** All core tasks complete and tested
**Git Commits:** 5 commits (551b305, de17316, 506e412, 675e167, + docs)
**Lines Changed:** 900+ insertions across 15+ files

- `bringForward()` - Moves objects up one layer (swaps z-index with object above)
- `sendBackward()` - Moves objects down one layer (swaps z-index with object below)
- Multi-select support: All functions work with single or multiple selected objects
- Smart layer swapping: Forward/backward operations skip already-selected objects

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**

- **Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + ]** → Bring to Front
- **Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + [** → Send to Back
- **Cmd/Ctrl + ]** → Bring Forward (one layer)
- **Cmd/Ctrl + [** → Send Backward (one layer)

**Git Commits:**

**Implementation Details:**

- Added `visible?: boolean` and `locked?: boolean` properties to BaseCanvasObject
- LayerItem now reads object's actual visibility/lock state from Firestore
- LayerPanel updates Firestore when toggles are clicked
- ObjectRenderer filters out invisible objects (visible !== false)
- Locked objects cannot be:
  - Dragged or moved
  - Resized or transformed
  - Edited (text objects can't be double-clicked)
  - Deleted
  - Modified in any way
- Emoji indicators automatically reflect state:
  - 👁️ = Visible, 🙈 = Hidden
  - 🔓 = Unlocked, 🔒 = Locked
- All state changes sync in real-time across all users
- Backward compatible: defaults to visible=true, locked=false if undefined

**Git Commits:**
